% Style guide for all types of paper:
%   - for `author`, use `Surname, Firstname` format
%   - use `doi` whenever known. If a DOI exists, there is no need for a separate
%     link to the publisher page in the `url` field
%   - use `pdf` for authors' preprints, and use `url` for the primary URL of a resource
%   - for arxiv preprints, use `eprint = {1806.10254}` (but not `url`);
%     for arxiv-only articles, use `url` linking to the abstract page (`/abs/...`)

% Style guide for conference papers:
%   - use `booktitle` for full name of the conference (not including "Proceedings of the")
%   - use `series` for conference abbreviation including 4-digit year
%   - keep `publisher` as short as possible: e.g. ACM, IEEE, Springer
%   - for volumes in a series, don't use `volume`, but put the number in the
%     `publisher` field instead, e.g. `publisher = {Springer LNCS volume 8460}`
%   - use `pages` and/or `articleno`, but not `number`
%   - don't use `editor`, `location`, `address`, or `organization`

% Style guide for tech reports:
%   - use `institution` for publishing organisation and `number` for report number
%   - use e.g. `type = {Research Report}` to customise the term "tech report"
